The surface of revolution code developed in this project was provided by the CSCI 4611 course and the lighting work was added by
myself as the requested for the project to light surfaces of revolutions.

The program may be opened in chrome by running the program3-vince145 document using webGL and javascript.
The surface of revolution may be rotated by dragging the left mouse button and adjusted in physical properties by adjusting the
number of angles and steps per curve as well as the material or texture.
Different materials and textures have varying material properties setup to obtain correct lighting of the surface of revolution.
