This was a project for csci4611 that involves using webGL and javascript to use bezier curves to create surfaces of revolutions.
A base template of the javascript code was provided from the CSCI4611 course at the UMN while code was added by myself to create the
bezier curve, setup user functionality, and create the surface of revolution aspects.
The program may be ran in chrome by opening program2_vince145.

The gray bezier curve control points may be dragged using the left mouse button to shift the bezier curve in the draw mode.
The surface of revolution may be rotated and viewed in the view mode.
